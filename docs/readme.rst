StoReS (Storage of Reionization Simulations) is a python package for accessing publicly available simulations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD). The source files can be found `here <https://github.com/sambit-giri/StoReS>`_.

Note: There are some modules in the package that are still under active development. Therefore please contact the authors if you get erronous results.


Package details
===============

The package provides methods to download and read publicly available simulations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD).

Input
-----

Currently, `StoReS` can download and read the following simulation data:

* |cubep3m|_: a high performance cosmological N-body code
* |c2ray|_: a numerical method for calculating 3D radiative transfer and for simulating the EoR and CD


.. |c2ray| replace:: C\ :sup:`2`\RAY
.. _c2ray: https://github.com/garrelt/C2-Ray3Dm

.. |cubep3m| replace:: CUBEP\ :sup:`3`\M
.. _cubep3m: https://github.com/jharno/cubep3m

Outputs
-------

`StoReS` can provide the following outputs. 

* Download the simulation data
* Read the simulation data
